- Initial setup

> When keeping the prism for multiple readings, keep it with the distance of 4 cm from the previous one. This is to optimize the space of the paper

# Important point

- Why should we use an equilateral prism for this experiment?
```
Otherwise, we won't be able to see the refraction as above
```

- Why can we get 2 pairs of readings by just measuring the i1 and i2 for one angle?
```
Because we can take the initial i1 as the i2 for a second pair by interchanging the direction of light entering the prism. This is due to the principle or reversibility of light.
```

- Why should we keep the pins `P1` and `P2` with maximum distance apart?

```
To reduce the error when drawing the lines
```

- When comparing 2 prisms, if the prism angle changes, what are the factors that will change with it?

```
Mimimum deviation will change - if A is higher, the D will be higher, when A is lower, D will be relatively lower

The way the graph of d and i is drawn changes. I.e when A = 60 the graph will start from i = 30 (becuase any incident angle before 30 degrees will result in total internal reflection) but if the A = 30, the graph for i will start from 0 as no total internal reflection will happen.
```

$$
\begin{align*}
A &- Prism\ Angle\\ 
D &- Diviation\\ 
\\
A &\propto D
\end{align*}
$$
