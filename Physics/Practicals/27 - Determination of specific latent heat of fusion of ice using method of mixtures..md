- Initial Setup

- Measurements you need to take in the correct order.

1. Measure the mass of the calorimeter with the stirrer. $M_1$ - ($M_c$)
2. Fill the calorimeter with water and then measure the mass. $M_2$ - ($M_c +M_w$)
3. Initial temperature of water $\theta_1$
4. Get the lowest temperature after adding ice $\theta_2$
5. Final mass of calorimeter + stirrer + ice $M_3$

> Here $\theta_1 > \theta_2$

A - Temperature of calorimeter + stirrer + water decreasing when ice cubes are added.
B - 0C ice turning into 0C water.
C - 0C water getting heated and coming into an equilibrium with water in the calorimeter.

After taking these readings, we can find the specific heat capacity of the ice using the equation $H = ML$  for the phase change of ice to water and we use $H =ms\theta$ for the other heat exchanges

So we assume that the heat gained from the ice cubes are equal to the heat released by the water and calorimeter


$$
\begin{align*}
M_s =& Mass\ of\ ice\ added\ (M_3 - M_2) = Mass\ of\ water\ added\\
&(As\ the\ same\ ice\ is\ melt\ in\ to\ water)\\
M_w =& Mass\ of\ initial\ water\ in\ calorimeter\ (M_2 - M_1)\\
M_c =& Mass\ of\ the\ calorimeter\ +\ Stirer (M_1)
\\\\
L =& Spefic\ latemt\ heat\ of\ fussion\ of\ water\\
S_w =& Spefic\ heat\ capacity\ of\ water (4200)\\
S_c =& Spefic\ heat\ capacity\ of\ calorimeter(4000)\\
\\
H =& mS\delta\theta = ML \\
M_sL + M_sS_w(\theta_2 - 0) =& M_cS_c(\theta_1 - \theta_2) + M_wS_w(\theta_1 - \theta_2)
\\ \\
\therefore L =& \frac{(M_cS_c + M_wS_w)(\theta_1 - \theta_2) -M_sS_w(\theta_2 - 0) }{M_s}
\end{align*}

# Important point

- Why should we use a net stirrer to stire this instead of a normal one?
```
As the density of ice is less than water ice floats on water. Therefore to keep them in the bottom we need a net stirrer

- Why should we wipe the ice cubes with a blotting paper before adding it to the calorimeter?
```
To make sure its dry and no water is added with the ice cubes
```

- Which shape of ice is best for this experiment?
```
small-medium cubes

Large onces can't be used as we can't mantain the temperature the calorimeter gains and it might  have a temperature difference between the surface and the inner temperature (inner could have a negative temperature)
Crushed or really small ice cubes can't be used as we can't blot them for water practically.
