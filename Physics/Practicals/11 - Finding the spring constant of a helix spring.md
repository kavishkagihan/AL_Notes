# Finding the spring constant of a helix spring
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpdOWPBy5AU)


> There is a relationship between the time period of oscillation (T) and the mass (m) we attach to a helix spring when oscillating

$$
\begin{align*}
T &= 2\pi\sqrt(\frac{m}{k}) \\ 
\therefore T^2 &= \frac{4\pi^2}{k}m \\ 
y &= mx
\end{align*}
$$

- Initial setup

- Even though we can start with any mass, we use a mass of 100g or more. Why?

```
With 50g, you might not be able to get a enough extension of the spring to get the time period for 20-25 osccilations. Therefore we start with 100g
```
> This is totally dependent on the spring constant of the spring. If you are using a spring with a lower spring constant, even 50g could be enough to get a appropriate extension to count 20 oscillations


- What is the arrangement you have to change every time you increase the mass?

```
You need to make sure the pointer is parallel(colinear) with the pointer of the spring
```

> The unit of the spring constant is $Nm^{-1}$

- For the equation $T = 2\pi\sqrt(\frac{m}{k})$ we don't consider the mass of the spring, if we take that as well, the equation becomes as follows


$$
\begin{align*}
mass\ of\ the\ object\ = M \\
mass\ of\ the\ spring\ = m \\
\therefore T = 2\pi\sqrt(\frac{M + \frac{m}{3}}{k})
\end{align*}
$$
- To draw the graph, we have to re-arrange it as follows

$$
\begin{align*}
T &= 2\pi\sqrt(\frac{M + \frac{m}{3}}{k}) \\
T^2 &= (\frac{4\pi^2}{k})M +  (\frac{4\pi^2m}{3k}) \\
y &= mx +c
\end{align*}
$$
