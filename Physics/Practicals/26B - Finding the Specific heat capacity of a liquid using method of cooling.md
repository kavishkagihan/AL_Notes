This is using the same methods and the calculations used in the [26A - Verifying newton's cooling law](26A%20-%20Verifying%20newton's%20cooling%20law.md) practical, but here we do this for water and another liquid with unknown specific heat capacity. 


- Concept
> Here since we are using the same calorimeter and same volume of liquid for both the times, **the rate of loosing heat ($\frac{dH}{dt}$) will be the same for both**. 

 Using that relation we can find the unknown specific heat capacity.


$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dH}{dt} &= MS\frac{d\theta}{dt}\\\\
(M_cS_c + M_wS_w)\frac{d\theta}{dt}_w &= (M_cS_c + M_lS_l)\frac{d\theta}{dt}_l\\  
(M_cS_c + M_wS_w)\frac{\delta \theta}{t_w} &= (M_cS_c + M_lS_l)\frac{\delta \theta}{t_l}\\\\
\therefore \frac{(M_cS_c + M_wS_w)}{{t_w}} &= \frac{(M_cS_c + M_lS_l)}{t_l}\ 
\end{align*}
$$

From this we can find $S_l$

> Here, $t_w$ is for time it took for water go for $\delta \theta$ temperature difference
> Here, $t_l$ is for time it took for the liquid go for $\delta \theta$ temperature difference

# Important points

All the points in [26A - Verifying newton's cooling law](26A%20-%20Verifying%20newton's%20cooling%20law.md) are applied here 
 
 - Why do we have to use the same calorimeter for both the experiments?
```
To make sure the same area of the calorimeter is used to cooling for both - same A
To make sure the cooling constant for both - same K
```
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dH}{dt}= KA(\theta_S - \theta_R)
\end{align*}
$$


- Why do we have to use the same volume of water inside the calorimeter?
```
To make sure the same conditions are applied for both the times
To make sure the same surface area of the calorimeter is used for cooling conditions
```
