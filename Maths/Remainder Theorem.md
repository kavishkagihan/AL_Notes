Here since we take quotient as `Q(x)` as it really doesn't matter and the remainder as `Ax +B` cuz **when any degree 3 polynomial is divided by a degree 2 polynomial the remainder should be linear**. 
Then we get 2 equations and subject what you dont know which A and B respectively. Then we substitute the values that we were given eariler to show what we are asked.

In here, since we don't know the `Q(x)` we can ignore it and use it like this. When a 4th degree polynomial is divided by a linear factor, the remainder should be **3rd degree**. Therefore, we can get the remainder as `ax^2 + bx +c` for now and derive simultaneous equations like this.

In here, normally what we would do is to get the `f(x)` as $Ax^4+Bx^3+9x^2+Cx+D$ and then try to apply remainder theorem. But since they have already given that $(x-2)^2$ is a factor, we can write `f(x)` as $(x-2)^2(Ax^2 + Bx + C)$. This way, the number of variables we have to find becomes less.
