# Quadratic Graphs

### For a given function f(x) we can do completing square and find the nature of the graph of that f(x)

```
f(x) = x^2 - 2x - 3  <-------- Completing square
f(x) = (x-1)^2 -4
```

- Here, the sign of the square term represents whether the graph is minimum or maximum. If its `+ --> Miminum`, or if its `- --> Maximum` 
```
+(x-1)^2 --> Minimum
```

> We can also say whether if it's minimum or maximum by looking at the sign of `a` when the function is in the format of `ax^2 + bx + c`

```
a > 0 -> Minimum
a < 0 -> Maximum
```

- The square term itself gives the axis of symmetry of the graph
```
(x-1)^2
x - 1 = 0
x = 1
```

- The term outside the square term gives the minimum or the maximum value
```
y = -4
```
