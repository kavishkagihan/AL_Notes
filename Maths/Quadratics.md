### Nature of the roots according to the discriminant

```
D = b^2 - 4ac
```

If the discriminant is,
- positive, there are 2 real roots
- 0, there is one root (irl there are 2 roots which are coincident)
- negative, no real roots

```
D --> (+) --> 2 real roots
D --> (0) --> 1 real root
D --> (-) --> No real roots
```
