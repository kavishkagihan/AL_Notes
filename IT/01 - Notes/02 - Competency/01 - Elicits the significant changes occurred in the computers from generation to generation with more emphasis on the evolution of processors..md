# Elicits the significant changes occurred in the computers from generation to generation with more emphasis on the evolution of processors.

Time from the first computer to present are divided into 4 periods
	- Pre mechanical era
	- Mechanical era
	- Electro mechanical era
	- Electronic era

1. Pre mechanical era (before 1450)
	1. Abacus  
		- **World's first calculating device**  

2. Mechanical era (1450-1840)
	1. Pascaline 
		- by **French mathematician Blaise Pascal**
		- Only addition and subtraction of 2 numbers can be done
	2. Stepped Reckoner
		- by **German scientist Gottfried Wilhelm**
		- device carried out the operations addition, subtraction, multiplication and division too.
	3. Difference engine
		- **first mechanical computer**
		- by **Charles Babbage** (also made the Analytical Engine)
		- *the concept of  input, process and output that is used* therefore, he is known as the Father of computing

3. Electromechanical era (1840 – 1940)
	1. Electronic valve (vacuum tube) 
		- by **American inventor Lee De Forest**
	2. Automatic sequence controller (Mark 1)
		- **the first automatic computer**
		- by American physicist and computing Professor **Howard Aiken**

4. Electronic Era
	- Divided into 5 generations
	1. 1st Generation Computers
		-  **vacuum tubes** are used as the basic component
		1. **ENIAC** (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator)
			- by **John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert**
			- **first electronic digital computer with stored program concept** 
			- decimal related
		2. **EDSAC** (Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator)
			- by **Maurice Wilkes**
			- built according to the *von Neumann machine principles* (by John von Neumann)
		3. **EDVAC** (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer)
			- **first digital computer to with stored program concept**
			- binary related 
			- by **John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert**
		4. **UNIVAC** (Universal Automatic Computer)
			- more vacuum tubes are used
			- utilized punch cards and switches to input data and punch cards to output
			- by **John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert**

	2. 2nd Generation Computers
		-  **transistors** are used as the basic component
			- transistors were invented by **William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain**
		- computers like IBM 1620, IBM 7094, CDC 1604, CDC 3600, UNIVAC 1108 were invented

	3. 3rd Generation Computers (1964 – 1975)
		- **Integrated circuits** (IC) are used as the basic component
			- ICs are made by collection of transistors
			- 2 types of ICs were invented **by Jack Kilby** (with silicon) and  **Robert Noyce** (with germanium)  separately
		- IBM-360 series, PDP, TDC-316, PDP 11 were the computers of 3rd generation.
	4. 4th Generation (1975 – 1989)
		- VLSI (Very Large Scale Integrated) are used as the basic component
		- single chip was made allowing to make micro computers
		- DEC 10, STAR 1000

	5. 5th Generation Computers (1989 – present)
		 - ULSI (Ultra Large Scale Integration) are used as the basic components

## Classification of Computers

- Computers
	- Purpose
		- General
		- Specific
	- Technology
		- Analog
		- Digital
		- Hybrid
	- Size
		- Super 
		- Main frame 
		- Mini
		- Micro
			- Desktop
			- Portable

###### Based on the Technology

1. Analog Computer

	- handles continuous values such as electrical, mechanical, or hydraulic quantities and environmental parameters (speed, pressure, and temperature).
	- Speedometers, road lamps with sensors and meteorological  machines

2. Digital Computers
	- used by us in day-to-day life

3. Hybrid Computers

	- combination of analog and digital  computers
	- ECG machine - machine identifies the function of the heart beat which is an analog signal. Then it is  converted to a digital signal and these converted signals are printed  by this machine

###### Based on Size

1. Super Computer
	- fastest and most powerful type of computers
	- are used for highly calculation intensive tasks such as weather forecasting, climate research, molecular modeling, physical simulation
2. Mainframe Computer
	- supporting hundreds, or even thousands, of users at the same times
	- very large and expensive computer
	- typical applications are the airline systems, central data banks
	- Univac 1100/10, Univac 1100/60, Honeywell
3. Mini Computer
	- mid-size computers
	- cheaper in cost, smaller and reliable than mainframe computers
	- does not require air conditioning
	- can be operated in room temperature
4. Micro Computer
	- Desktop, laptop, notebook
