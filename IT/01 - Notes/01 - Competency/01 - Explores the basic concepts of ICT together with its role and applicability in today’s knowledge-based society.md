# Explores the basic concepts of ICT together with its role and applicability in todayâ€™s knowledge-based society

## Data 
 ```
Data is a raw and unorganized fact which input into the system in order to process to make it meaningful information. (numbers, words, sounds)
```
- Data is always interpreted
- Always an input

Two types of data
1. Quantitative data - information that can be measured or counted and written down with numbers
	* Discrete data - with only integer values
	* Continuous data - information that can't actually be measured but can identify as properties of something
2. Qualitative data - information that can't actually be measured but can identify as properties of something

##### Life cycle of data
1. Data creation - New data should be introduced to the system or created inside itself
2. Management - Keeping data securely and making them accessible 
3. Removal of obsolete data - outdated and found to be unnecessary anymore, it's the time to remove that data from the system  

##### Data Processing Life cycle 
1. Data gathering
2. Data Validation
3. Data Processing
4. Generating Output
5. Data Storage

## Information
```
Set of data created by processing data to a requirement in a meaningful manner that it can be used to make decisions.
```

* Information can be output of a process while it can be input to another process.
* Can be either an input or an output.

```
Information = Data + Context + Meaning
```

##### Value of information
Valuable information should have characteristics such as, 
- Relevance - dependent of a particular person
- Timeliness - should be updated
- Accuracy - to get correct decisions
- Completeness - not sufficient to make decisions
- Understandability - should be clear

The golden rule of information - Value of information decreases with the time.

### Big Data Analysis

- What is Big data

```
Massive amount of data collected from differnet sources that can't be maintaned in a usual management method  
```

**Examples**
- Sources - images, videos, social media. 
- Environments and technologies - NoSQL, Hadoop, MapReduce

Properties of big data (4v)
- Volume 
- Variety 
- Velocity
- Veracity 

###### Applicability of information in day to day life
- Decision-making
- Policymaking
- Prediction
- Planning 

###### Pitfalls of manual data processing 
- Consume more time.
- Human errors.
- Inefficient (when providing and sharing)
- Inability to provide a quality service.
- Data inconsistency - same data in two sources in different manner (kavi, Kavi)

###### Automatic data processing.

```
Utilizing technology to store, process and retrieve data.
```

* Human attraction is less, therefore job opportunities get lowered.
