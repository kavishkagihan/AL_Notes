# Classifies the basic components of a computer


###### Basic components of a computer system

1. Hardware - collection of physical parts of the computer
2. Software - set of programs which is designed to perform a well-defined functions.
3. Firmware - Boot up instructions stored in the ROM
4. Liveware - User

#### Hardware

1. Input devices
	- MICR - used in banks to read cheques
	- OCR - to read a printed text (edit PDFs)
	- OMR - used for checking the answer sheets of examinations having multiple choice questions

2. Output devices
	- Monitors/ Visual Display Unit (VDU), are the main output device of a computer
		-  CRT - made up of small picture elements called pixels
		-  Flat-Panel
			-  Emissive Displays - convert electrical energy into light (plasma panel)
			- Non-emissive Displays - use optical effects to convert sunlight or light from some other source into graphics patterns

	 - Printers
		- Impact
			- 2 types as **Character printers** and **Line printers**
			- Features 
				- Very low consumable costs 
				- Very noisy 
				- Useful for bulk printing due to low cost 
				- There is physical contact with the paper to produce an image
			- Examples:
				- Dot matrix - printing character by character
		- Non-Impact
			- 2 types as **Laser Printers**, **Ink jet Printers**
			- Features
				• Faster than impact printers 
				• They are not noisy 
				• High quality 
				• Supports many fonts and different character size
				• Laser printers use a powder stored in a **toner** while inkjet printers use a liquid ink stored in a **cartridge**	
			 - Examples
				 - Thermal printer- printed by heating coated thermo chromic paper
				
3. Processing devices
	- CPU - for arithmetic and logical processing
		- Features
			- Brain of the computer
			- Performs all types of data processing
			- stores data, results, instructions
			- controls all parts
			- includes memory registers
		- 3 components
			- Storage unit (Registers)
			- Control unit
			- ALU (Arithmetic and Logical Unit)
	- GPU - for graphic processing
		- used in personal computers, gaming consoles, workstations

4. Network devices
	- NIC - to connect to a network
		- Internal cards
		- External cards
			- 2 types as USB and Wireless 
	- Router
	- Switch

5. Memory devices
	- Used to store data and instructions
	1. Primary memory (RAM/cache)
		- ***Memory that can be accessed directly by the CPU***
		- Volatile (memory is gone after turning off the device)
	2. Cache memory
		- High speed, semiconductor
		- acts as a buffer between the CPU and the main memory
		- (Also a part of primary memory)
	3. Secondary memory
		- slower than the main memory
		- external memory or non-volatile
		- contents of secondary memories are first transferred to the main memory, and then the CPU can access it


#### Software

There are 2 types of software
1. System software
2. Application software

- System software

```
To operate and control the computer hardware and to provide a platform for running application software
```

1. Operating systems - Windows, Linux
2. Utility software - AV, Disk cleanup
3. Language translators - Compiler, Interpreter, Assembler

- Application software

```
Designed to satisfy a particular need of a particular environment
```

**Softwares** are also divided as,
1. Open Source Software 
	- source code is available and it is free to use, modify or redistribute these type of software
1. Proprietary Software 
	- source code is not available and user should have the permission given by owner of the software to use this type of software.


#### Firmware

```
Firmware is a computer program that is embedded in a hardware device, that is, an essential part of the hardware
```
Firmware is stored in ROM to handle the booting process

#### Liveware

Liveware refers to computer users
