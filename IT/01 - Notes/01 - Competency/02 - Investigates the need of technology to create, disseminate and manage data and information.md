```
A computer is an electronic device, operating under the control of instructions stored in its own memory unit, which can accept and store data, perform arithmetic and logical operations on that data without human interactions to produce output.
```

###### Functions of digital computer

1. Takes data as input
2. Stores data
3. Processes data and converts into information
4. Generates output
5. Controls all the above 4 steps

Computer follows the abstract model, therefore it's a system

###### Advantages of computer

1. High speed
2. Reliability
3. Versatility
4. Automation
5. Accuracy
6. Reduction of paper-work, cost


###### Disadvantages of computer

1. Dependent
2. No IQ
