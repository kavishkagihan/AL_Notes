# Agent-Based Systems

- What is an agent?

```
An agent is anything that can perceive its environment (through its sensors) and act upon that environment (through its effectors)
```

>An agent get the precepts from the environment through sensors.
 Then they perform actions to the environment from the effectors. Ex: Siri, Cortana

An agent can be either software or hardware based
##### Characteristics of Agents

- Autonomous
- Able to learn
- Proactive
- Cooperative
- Easy to adaptive
- Mobility and versatility

##### Applications of Agent systems

- Cortana in Windows and Siri on Apple iOS systems are good examples of software agent.
- Agents assist humans in banking, e-learning, e-commerce, booking, and various other similar systems.
- Online booking systems too involve such architecture to filter information on behalf of the users.



##### Classification of software agents

# Multi-agent systems

```
Software agents that can interact with other software agents to execute a common task.
```

This is due to the cooperative characteristic of agents.

##### Characteristics of multi-agent systems

- Autonomous: meaning that they can make independent decisions by being self-aware
- **Having only a local view**: meaning that they only know how to execute their part and cannot see beyond their scope
- Acting in a decentralized manner: meaning that no agent to control the system


> A user gets some information through an `information broker agent` from multiple sources. Then the user interacts with the broker through an `interface agent`

##### Advantages of multi-agent systems

- Cost effectiveness as it saves transportation and no need of physical presence.
- Convenience to the buyer.

ii) Being able to cooperatively work together and provide information to the user efficiently and faster
iii) sub-agents should be compatible to interact with the domain-agents that they are operated under.
