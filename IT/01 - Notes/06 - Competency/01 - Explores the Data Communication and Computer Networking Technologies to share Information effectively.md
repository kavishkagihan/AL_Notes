# Explores the Data Communication and Computer Networking Technologies to share Information effectively

1. What is Data Communication
```
Data communications refers to the transmission of digital data (usually in binary form) between two or more computers or any communicating devices over some transmission media.
```

2. What is a computer network
```
A system of interconnected computers and computerized peripherals
```

- The main reason of establishing a network is to **share information**

### A Data Communication Model

1. Transmitter / Sender - Generates and prepares data to be transmitted
2. Transmission system (Protocol, Medium, Signal) - Responsible for transmitting data towards destination
3. Destination / Receiver / Sink - Receives data from the transmission system and hands it over to the application

### Protocols

```
To data communication to be successful, a certain set of rules have to be followed. These set of rules are called a protocol.
```
### Synchronization and Acknowledgement

### Signals

```
A signal is an electrical or electromagnetic current that is used for carrying data from one device or network to another
```

There are 2 types of signals 
1. Analog
2. Digital

#### Properties of Signals

1. Amplitude - height of the wave, measured in meters and often related to power.
2. Frequency - number of times a specified event occurs within a specified time interval.
3. Wavelength - distance between similar points on two back-to-back waves.
4. Phase - same frequency, same cycle, same wavelength, but are 2 or more wave forms not exactly aligned together

#### Propagation speed in a media

```
The speed at which a wave propagates (broadcast) through a given medium
