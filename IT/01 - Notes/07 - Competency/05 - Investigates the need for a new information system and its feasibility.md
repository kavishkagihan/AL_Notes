# Investigates the need for a new information system and its feasibility

### **Preliminary Investigation**

Preliminary investigation is done in two phases namely,
1. Problem definition - a preliminary survey of the system is carried out to identify the scope of the system. 
2. Feasibility study -  the proposed system is evaluated for its feasibility. Feasibility of a system means whether the development of a new or improved system is practical and beneficial.

#### What is Feasibility Study?

```
Feasibility is defined as the practical extent to which a project can be performed successfully.

**The objective of the feasibility study**
- To analyze whether the software will meet organizational requirements.
- To determine whether the software can be implemented using the current technology
- To determine whether the software can be integrated with other existing software

**Types of Feasibility**
- **Technical feasibility** - this evaluates whether the developers have ability to construct the proposed system. Check whether the developers have the enough technical knowledge to build the system
- **Economical feasibility** - this studies cost and benefits to evaluate whether the benefits justify the investments in the system development
- **Operational feasibility** - this assesses the willingness and ability of the users to support and use the proposed system
- **Organizational feasibility** - this determines the extent to which the proposed system supports the objectives of the organizationâ€™s strategy. Check whether will this system help the organization as a subset.
