# Compares and contrasts different types of man-made systems in terms of their objectives and functionality

- What is an Information System?

```
Information systems are interrelated components working together to collect, process, store, and disseminate information to support decision making, coordination, control, analysis, and visualization in an organization.
```

A typical organization has 3 sections as,
- Operational - Operational management   (L3)
- Middle - Tactical management                  (L2)      
- Upper level - Strategic Management        (L1)

##### **Operational level**
- The operational level is concerned with **performing day to day business transactions** of the organisation
- Users at this level **make structured decisions**
- Cashiers at a point of sale, bank tellers, nurses in a hospital, customer care staff

##### **Tactical Management Level**
- This organisation level is dominated by middle-level managers, heads of departments, supervisors
- oversee the activities of the users at the operational management level.
- Tactical users make **semi-structured decisions**

##### **Strategic Management Level**
- This is the most senior level in an organisation
- The users at this level make unstructured decisions
- They use information from tactical managers and external data to guide them when making unstructured decisions.

### Different Types of Manmade Information Systems

- Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) - L3
- Management Information Systems (MIS) - L2
- Decisions Support Systems (DSS)  - L1
- Office Automation Systems (OAS) - All
- Executive Support Systems (ESS) - L1
- Geographical Information Systems (GIS) - All 
- Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) - All 
- Content Management Systems (CMS) - 
- Enterprise Resource Planning Systems (ERPS) 
- Expert Systems
- Smart Systems

####  Transaction Processing Systems (TPS)

```
- Used to record day to day business transactions of the organization
- to answer routine questions
```

**Examples**
- Point of Sale Systems
- Payroll system
- Airline booking systems

#### Management Information Systems (MIS)

```
- used by tactical managers to monitor the organization's current performance status
- analyzes the input with routine algorithms 
	- i.e. aggregate, compare and summarizes the results to produced reports that tactical managers use to monitor, control and predict future performance.
	- i.e. predict how much of goods or inventory should be ordered for the second quarter based on the sales of the first quarter.
```

**Examples**
- Sales management systems
- Budget systems
- HR

####  Decisions Support Systems (DSS)

```
- used by senior management to make nonroutine decisions
- helps to predict the impact towars a cerain descision
- provide solutions to problems that are unique and change frequently 
- uses information from TPS and MIS
- use sophisticated mathematical models, and statistical techniques
	- i.e What would be the impact of employees' performance if we double the production lot at the factory?
```

**Examples**
- Financial planning systems
- Bank loan management systems

#### Office Automation Systems  (OAS)

```
- execute a variety of office operations, such as word processing, electronic spreadsheet, e-mail, and video conferencing.
- allows to get many tasks accomplished faster
- lets eleminate the need of a large staff
- less storage is needed to store data.
```

#### Executive Support Systems (ESS)

```
- reporting tool (software) that allows you to turn your organization's data into useful summarized reports
- reports are generally used by executive level managers
```

#### Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

```
- allow to map, model, query and analyze large quantities of data within a single database according to their location (GIS facilities)
```


#### Knowledge Management Systems (KMS)

```
- used in an organization to identify, create, represent, distribute and enable adoption of insight and experiences
- can help with staff training and orientation, support better sales
```

#### Content Management Systems (CMS)

```
- computer applications that support the creation and modification of digital content
```

#### Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)

```
- business process management systems that allow organizations to use integrated applications to manage the businesses
- integrates product planning, development, manufacturing, sales and marketing
```

#### Expert Systems

```
- computer applications that use artificial intelligence
- attempts to act like a human expert on a particular subject area
```

Such a system is made up of three parts:
- A user interface - This is the system that allows a non-expert user to query
- A knowledge base - This is a collection of facts and rules
- A inference engine - This acts rather like a search engine, examining the knowledge base for information

##### Uses of Expert systems

- Medical diagnosis
- Providing financial advice
- Helping to identify items 
- Helping to discover locations to drill for water

##### Problems related to expert systems
- Can't easily adapt to new circumstances and environment
	- If we need to add something new, the engineer should ask the expert (knowledge base) and add it to the system
- Can be difficult to use (mostly by the non-expert user)


#### Smart Systems

```
Smart systems are the ones which makes human life more and more easier & convenient. 
```

**Examples**
- Home Automation systems
