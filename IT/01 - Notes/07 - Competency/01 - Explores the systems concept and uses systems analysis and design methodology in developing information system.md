# Explores the systems concept and uses systems analysis and design methodology in developing information system

- What is a System?

```
A collection of inter-related components working together to achieve a common goal
```

There are 3 requirements to be satisfied in order to be a system
1. There should be an input
2. There should be a process
3. There should be an output

If any of these requirements aren't met, it's not considered as a system

### Classification of Systems

There are 3 main groups of systems
- Open and closed systems
- Natural and man-made systems
- Living and non-living systems

#### Open System

```
A system that interacts freely with its environment, taking inputs and returning output.
```

>Living organisms are considered open systems because they take in substances from their environment

**Examples**
- living beings
- A pond

#### Closed System

```
Closed system refer to systems having relatively little interaction with other environment or the outside environment.
```

> No system in the real world is ever perfectly closed

**Examples**
- Human nervous system
- Blood circulatory system

#### Natural systems

```
Systems which are in the environment made by nature are called natural system
```

**Examples**
- Animals digestive system

#### Man-made systems

```
System which is made by man is called man made system
```

**Examples**
- Transport system
- Education system

#### Living systems

```
Living systems are open self-organizing living things that interact with their environment 
```

**Examples**
- Human digestive system# 

#### Non-living systems

```
The systems consist of nonliving things are categorized into physical systems
```

**Examples**
- Solar system

> Information system is a man-made, non-living, open system
